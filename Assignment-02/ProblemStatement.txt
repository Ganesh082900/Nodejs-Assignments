In this assignment, you will practice how to take input in these ways. We will take a name as input (e.g. Ravi) and print Hello Ravi.

This file should read a name (e.g. Ravi) as a command line argument and print a greeting Hello Ravi
* readEnvVariable.js
This file should read a name (e.g. Ravi) through an environment variable called USERNAME and print a greeting Hello Ravi
* readFromLine.js
This file should read a name (e.g. Ravi) from the user and print a greeting Hello Ravi
